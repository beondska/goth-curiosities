For this project I choose colors that felt retro, intimate and timeless. This color-scheme reflects the epoch in its best.


# TESTING
**Navigation Links**


Testing was performed to ensure all navigation links on the respective pages navigated to the correct pages as per design. This was done by clicking on the navigation links on each page.

Links on all pages navigated to the correct pages as expected. Include the Error page.


**W3C Validator**
[WC3](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate all HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


**Responsiveness**

All pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes as defined in WCAG 2.1 Reflow criteria for responsive design on Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari browsers. No horizontal scroll is present. No elements overlap.

**Lighthouse**
Used within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.
