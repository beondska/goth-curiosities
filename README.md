## Design
### Color Scheme

![Color Scheme](documents/coolors.png)
For this project I choose colors that felt retro, intimate and timeless. This color-scheme reflects the epoch in its best.


# TESTING
**Navigation Links**


Testing was performed to ensure all navigation links on the respective pages navigated to the correct pages as per design. This was done by clicking on the navigation links on each page.


|  Navigation Link   | Page to Load  |
| -----------------  |---------------|
|                    |               |
|                    |               |
|                    |               |
|                    |               |

Links on all pages navigated to the correct pages as expected. Include the Error page.


**W3C Validator**
[WC3](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate all HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Both CSS and all of the HTML pages: index.html , gallery.html, signup.html and 404.html no errors were founded.

**Lighthouse**
Used within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

# KNOWN ISSUES
In my first experience using GitHub, I initially misunderstood the process. I thought that even minor changes, such as fixing a typo or coding a single line, required committing and pushing to see the effects on my local copy of the website. So I thought I was doing something wrong, and I deleted the entire project and started over.
This is my first ever website project and I struggled with terms of coding and the design aspects mirroring from HTML to CSS files. I have learned a lot from this, however there are still present issues on the website and I do hope to have the knowledge and focus on solving.


# DEPLOYMENTS
I published the GitHub page with my website by going to my repository settings and under the code and automations, thus deploying the website to be live.


# CREDITS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to extend some thanks, not only to the online resources, but also to my Mother and my Father who taught me how to read and the endearing love for books.

 To my mentor Rory Patrick who helped me when everything was a confusing and my friends: Andreas J. for the strength when I wanted to give up and to Willian, who aided me when I needed the most.
